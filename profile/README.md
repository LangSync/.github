## What is LangSync?

LangSync is an AI powered Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that allows your software (apps, websites, games, projects...) to target the global market by expanding your original JSON localization file(s), And, with the help of a powerful set of AI engines, it generates very accurate & effective new laungages localizations files that matches the context of your original one(s).

As example, taking a mobile app that supports only the English laungage, which saves all its English texts & strings in a `en.json` file, LangSync can literally take it, Then provides any other languages localization & translation by runinng a single command.
